A lambda expression is simply a function with no name; you can assign it to a variable and pass it around like any other
value. These have many uses, and become particularly useful when dealing with collections such as an array or map

Lambdas are also known as anonymous functions

For a lambda that has only one parameter, you can shorten it even further using the it keyword

Lambdas can also access variables in their scope where they are defined and this is ver useful
