/* 1. Declare two constants a and b of type Double and assign both a value. Calculate
    the average of a and b and store the result in a constant named average.*/

/* 2. A temperature expressed in °C can be converted to °F by multiplying by 1.8
    then incrementing by 32. In this challenge, do the reverse: convert a temperature
    from °F to °C. Declare a constant named fahrenheit of type Double and assign it a value.
    Calculate the corresponding temperature in °C and store the result in a constant named celcius.*/


/* 3. Suppose the squares on a chessboard are numbered left to right, top to bottom,
    with 0 being the top-left square and 63 being the bottom-right square.
    Rows are numbered top to bottom, 0 to 7. Columns are numbered left to right, 0 to 7.*/


/* 4. Declare a constant position and assign it a value between 0 and 63.
    Calculate the corresponding row and column numbers and store the results in constants
    named row and column. 8. A circle is made up of 2𝜋 radians, corresponding with 360 degrees.
    Declare a constant degrees of type Double and assign it an initial value. Calculate the corresponding
    angle in radians and store the result in a constant named radians.*/

/* 5. Declare four constants named x1, y1, x2 and y2 of type Double. These constants represent the two-dimensional
    coordinates of two points. Calculate the distance between these two points and store the result
    in a constant named distance*/
