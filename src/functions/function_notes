Functions are a core part of many programming languages. Simply put, a function lets you define a block of code
that performs a task. Then, whenever your app needs to execute that task, you can run the function instead of having
to copy and paste the same code everywhere

So functions in Kotlin pretty much work the same for parameters and a bunch of stuff like that

Functions can also be used to return a data type, where the data type has to be specified
