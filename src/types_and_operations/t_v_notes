All languages' characters are mapped in unicode. The number attached to the character is called a code point.
Even emojis are mapped in unicode. That's why I can write this: 😒😒

The word “emoji” comes from Japanese, where “e” means picture and “moji” means character

The char data type must be wrapped in single quotes ''

The string data type on the other hand must be wrapped in double quotes ""

Strings can be concatenated with other strings or even char

There is also string templates that employs the dollar sign

You can also use expressions in string template. However, care must be taken when using string templates
as you cannot control the output. Hence, using transcedental numbers could give you outputs that you don't like

kotlin also has multiline strings which aids readability. The strings appear as they are inputted in the editor
