All languages' characters are mapped in unicode. The number attached to the character is called a code point.
Even emojis are mapped in unicode. That's why I can write this: 😒😒

The word “emoji” comes from Japanese, where “e” means picture and “moji” means character

The char data type must be wrapped in single quotes ''

The string data type on the other hand must be wrapped in double quotes ""

Strings can be concatenated with other strings or even char

There is also string templates that employs the dollar sign

You can also use expressions in string template. However, care must be taken when using string templates
as you cannot control the output. Hence, using transcedental numbers could give you outputs that you don't like

kotlin also has multiline strings which aids readability. The strings appear as they are inputted in the editor

Pair or Triple are types that represent data composed of two or three values of any type.
If you want to have more than three values, you use what Kotlin calls a data clas

Type inference can infer Pair types too

The keyword "to" can be used to form pairs only that no parentheses is used and the the word Pair isn't used to

Kotlin allows you to use a destructuring declaration on individual parts of a Pair, and you can be explicit
about what each part represents. For example:
    val (x, y) = coordinatesInt

    where coordinates has been previously defined as a pair. Check the Pairs_Triple.kt for more info
    x and y both inferred to be of type Int
