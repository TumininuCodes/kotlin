Do you know that comments in Kotlin can be nested?

val is like value and var is like variable

In Kotlin, you can use underscores to make large numbers more readable

So shl is types_and_operations.a way of multiplying using 2 and shr is types_and_operations.a way of diving by 2

Increment in kotlin is +=
Decrement is -=
We also have /= and *=

val can never be reassigned so you can't use the assignment operator "="

All operators in kotlin can work with mixed operators

Sometimes it’s useful to check the inferred type of types_and_operations.a variable or constant. You can do this in IntelliJ by
clicking on the variable or constant’s name and holding down the Control + Shift + P keys.
IntelliJ will display types_and_operations.a popover

In Kotlin literal values like 3 have types_and_operations.a specific type, Int. If you want to convert them to types_and_operations.a different type,
you must do so explicitly, by calling toDouble() for example. A literal number value that contains types_and_operations.a decimal
point can only be used as types_and_operations.a Double and must be explicitly converted if you want to use it as something else
