In Kotlin, you can use underscores to make large numbers more readable

Increment in kotlin is +=
Decrement is -=

Sometimes it’s useful to check the inferred type of a variable or constant. You can do this in IntelliJ by
clicking on the variable or constant’s name and holding down the Control + Shift + P keys.

In Kotlin literal values like 3 have a specific type, Int. If you want to convert them to a different type,
you must do so explicitly, by calling toDouble() for example. A literal number value that contains a decimal
point can only be used as a Double and must be explicitly converted if you want to use it as something else
