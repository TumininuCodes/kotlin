A map is an unordered collection of pairs, where each pair is comprised of a key and a value

Maps are similar to dictionaries in Python

With arrays, out-of-bounds index access causes a runtime error, but not so for maps

In order to be able to examine how maps work, you need to understand what hashing is and how it works.
Hashing is the process of transforming a value — String, Int, Double, Boolean, etc — to a numeric value,
known as the hash value.  This value can then be used to quickly look up the values in a hash table

For performance-critical code, HashMap<K, V> should be used via hashMapOf(), instead of mapOf()
